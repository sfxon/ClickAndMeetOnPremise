# ClickAndMeetOnPremise
A standalone ticket software for webservers, built with php and mysql. Can be used as OnPremise solution.

## TODO

* Provide database installation files (initial dump).
* Write installation guide.
* Test.
* Build release.

## Notes

I suggest a refactoring of the appointment engine. Currently, all the appointments are created as fixed entries in the database. In a future version, I'd like to implement them as flexible appointments.
